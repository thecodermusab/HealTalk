<objective>
Implement profile picture uploads for all authenticated users (patient, psychologist, admin) with live UI updates.

Purpose: Replace mock avatar UX with real uploads stored in Uploadthing and persisted in the User image field.

Output: Settings pages show working avatar upload, preview, and persistence.

**Current state:**
- Settings pages show a “Change Photo” button with no functionality
- User image field exists in Prisma User model
- Session header/sidebar uses session image (may need refresh)

**Requirements:**
- Upload avatar image only
- Validate size/type
- Show success/error feedback
- Update UI with new image after upload
</context>

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add reusable avatar upload component</name>
  <files>src/components/profile/AvatarUploader.tsx (new)</files>
  <action>
Create a small client component that:
- Uses Uploadthing `UploadButton` (endpoint: `avatar`)
- Accepts current image URL and fallback initials
- Calls `onUploaded(url)` when complete
- Shows errors and upload state
  </action>
  <verify>
Component renders with an image preview and Uploadthing button.
  </verify>
  <done>
- Reusable avatar uploader exists for settings pages
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Wire avatar uploader into settings pages</name>

src/app/(dashboard)/patient/dashboard/settings/page.tsx
src/app/(dashboard)/psychologist/dashboard/settings/page.tsx
src/app/(dashboard)/admin/dashboard/settings/page.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
Replace the “Change Photo” UI with `AvatarUploader` and update local profile state on upload completion.

Ensure:
- Uses current `profile.image`
- Shows initials fallback when missing
- Displays success/error messages
  </action>
  <verify>
- Upload button exists and completes without errors
- New image shows immediately in settings
  </verify>
  <done>
- All settings pages use real avatar uploads
  </done>
</task>

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] Avatar uploader component exists
- [ ] Patient/Psychologist/Admin settings use uploader
- [ ] Successful upload updates image preview
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Profile photo uploads work end-to-end
- Avatar persists in database
- UI shows updated image
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/04-file-upload-system/04-02-SUMMARY.md`
