# Roadmap: HealTalk Mental Health Platform

## Overview

Transform HealTalk from a university project prototype into a production-ready mental health consultation platform. The journey progresses from foundational infrastructure (database, auth, environment setup) through core features (video calls, messaging, payments), security hardening, comprehensive testing, and finally production deployment. Each phase builds upon previous work, with all services using free tiers to maintain zero monthly costs until revenue generation.
