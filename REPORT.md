## Project Overview

Hello! I'm presenting **HealTalk**, a web-based mental health consultation platform that I built for my final year university project. This platform connects patients with licensed psychologists for online therapy sessions.

### What is HealTalk?

HealTalk is a complete mental health consultation system where:
- **Patients** can find psychologists, book appointments, and attend video sessions
- **Psychologists** can manage their profiles, schedules, and conduct online consultations
- **Admins** can manage the platform, approve psychologists, and monitor activities

### Project Goals

1. Make mental health support more accessible
2. Remove the barrier of physical distance between patients and psychologists
3. Provide a secure, private platform for therapy sessions
4. Create an affordable solution using free-tier services

---

## Problem Statement

### The Real-World Problem

Mental health support faces several challenges:

1. **Accessibility Issues**
   - Not everyone can visit a psychologist's office
   - People in remote areas have limited access
   - Busy schedules make in-person appointments difficult

2. **Privacy Concerns**
   - Some people feel uncomfortable visiting a therapy clinic
   - Stigma around mental health prevents people from seeking help

3. **Time and Cost**
   - Travel time to appointments
   - Limited appointment slots
   - Higher costs due to overhead

### My Solution

Build a web platform that allows people to:
- Find psychologists from home
- Book appointments online
- Attend therapy sessions via video call
- Message their psychologist between sessions
- Track their mental health progress

All while keeping their information private and secure.

## Solution

### What I Built

I created a full-stack web application with:

**For Patients:**
- Browse and search psychologists by specialization
- View detailed psychologist profiles (experience, ratings, pricing)
- Book appointments with online payment
- Attend video consultations from home
- Send messages to psychologists
- Save favorite psychologists
- Leave reviews and ratings
- Track therapy progress

**For Psychologists:**
- Create and manage professional profiles
- Set availability and pricing
- Accept/decline appointment requests
- Conduct video consultations
- Message patients
- Track earnings and payment history
- View appointment calendar

**For Admins:**
- Approve new psychologist registrations
- Verify credentials and licenses
- Manage users and content
- View platform analytics
- Moderate reviews and reports

## Conclusion

### Project Summary

I successfully built **HealTalk**, a production-ready mental health consultation platform that:

✅ Solves real-world accessibility problems in mental healthcare
✅ Uses modern, industry-standard technologies
✅ Implements complex features (video calls, payments, real-time messaging)
✅ Follows security best practices
✅ Costs $0/month to run using free tiers
✅ Is deployed and accessible on the internet
✅ Has been thoroughly tested

### Personal Growth

This project pushed me far beyond my comfort zone. I learned:
- How to build production applications, not just tutorials
- How to integrate multiple third-party services
- How to handle real-world constraints (zero budget, Turkey payment restrictions)
- How to follow industry best practices
- How to persist through challenges

### Why This Matters

Mental health support is crucial but often inaccessible. This platform demonstrates how technology can:
- Remove geographical barriers
- Reduce stigma through private online sessions
- Make therapy more affordable
- Connect people with the right professionals

### Final Thoughts

When I started this project, I had a basic Next.js prototype with mock data. Through structured planning and execution, I transformed it into a complete, production-ready platform with:
- 13 major features
- Real authentication
- Live video consultations
- Actual payment processing
- Professional deployment

The most important lesson: **Complex projects become manageable when broken into phases.**

I'm proud of what I built, and I believe this project demonstrates my readiness for a career in software engineering.
